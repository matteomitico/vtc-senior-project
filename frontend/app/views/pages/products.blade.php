			<p>The main purpose of Cloud System is to create and run “Virtual Machines”. The user can ask the system to create and to install the “Virtual Machine” and and use an operating system of his/her choice. To use this system, the user only needs a computer device and a browser because the “Front End” of the system will be implemented as a “Web Application”. These are all pieces that will build a user experience. The client will be able rent out server time with the appropriate processing power to complete general tasks that they would like to complete. For example, some tasks that could be completed with our system are: hosting a file server, hosting a web server, image manipulation, computing complex math (e.g. computing a section of the human genome).</p>
