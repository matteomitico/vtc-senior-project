This project consists of two parts: back-end and front-end
Copy the contents of Senior-Project/front-end folder into root of public http folder on the server.
The main application is loacted in .../front-end/public/
The admin application is located in /url-to/front-end/phpvirtualbox-4.1-11 (username: admin, password: admin)

move or copy back-end/python-sripts into ~/cluster/pyhton-scripts,
create ~/cluster/VMs folder, this is where all the VM template live. If you change these locations, search and replace the path to these folders on the application to match with the new location.

Follow this steps to setup the IP address:
1) get internet configuration: /sbin/ifconfig -a 

2) change the ssh connection in debian section of .../front-end/app/config/remote.php
   fix the debian env in .../front-end/app/bootstrap/start.php
   Note: debian is only a name, it doesn't matter what linux you run

3) to run vbphpadmin (the admin part of the project), change the ip address in ~/runvboxwebsrv to match with your ip. them run this file
go to front-end/phpvirtualbox-4.1-11/config.php and change the line 
var $location = 'http://155.42.97.220:18083/'; with your IP (the port remains the same)

4) change the ip address in ~/cluster/python-scripts/add_vm.py

done.

Set the .htaccess in your serve for pretty url
here are some example, change them as you need:

.htaccess on the server:
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /cluster/frontend/site/public
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
</IfModule>
